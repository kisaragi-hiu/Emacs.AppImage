* Build process of this AppImage

After push, or after a manual workflow trigger, the =build= GitHub Actions workflow starts running.

After setting some things up, =build-emacs.mjs= is executed.

- It takes a version string,
- installs the build dependencies
- downloads the tarball for that version,
- applies patches from [[https://github.com/purcell/nix-emacs-ci][purcell/nix-emacs-ci]]
- builds Emacs with the right options,
- then installs the just-built Emacs onto the system, ready for the packaging script to take over.

After this, we package the AppImage with =package-appimage.mjs=. This sets up AppDir then packs everything with =appimagetool=.

The built images are then uploaded to a release with =svenstaro/upload-release-action=. This is, for whatever reason, way faster than uploading artifacts ([[https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/199]]).
