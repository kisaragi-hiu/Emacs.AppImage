* AppImages for Emacs

AppImages for many versions of Emacs\*\*.

AppImages are built on GitHub Actions and distributed

I used https://github.com/probonopd/Emacs.AppImage as a starting point.

- 21 :: no support for x86-64
- 22 :: Make returns error; probably needs ancient Make
- 23 :: “crt*.o not found”; probably needs GCC 4.8
- 24 :: libgif issue
- 25 :: Usable. Next: enable xwidgets
- 26 :: Usable. Next: enable xwidgets
- 27 :: Usable. Next: fix pdmp loading & enable xwidgets
- 28 :: TODO

** TODO Emacs 27 pdmp isn't being loaded properly
** TODO Enable native compilation for 28 (probably requires pdmp to work properly)
** TODO Also build for other minor versions
** TODO Enable xwidgets

Needs [[https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev][libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev]]

** TODO Emacs <= 23

These need GCC 4.8, it seems.
