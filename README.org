* AppImages for Emacs

AppImages for many versions of Emacs\*\*.

AppImages are built on GitHub Actions and distributed

I used https://github.com/probonopd/Emacs.AppImage as a starting point.

* TODO Also build for other minor versions
* TODO Enable xwidgets

Needs [[https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev][libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev]]

* TODO Emacs 27 pdmp isn't being loaded properly
* TODO Emacs <= 23

These need GCC 4.8, it seems.
