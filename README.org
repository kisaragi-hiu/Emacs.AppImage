* AppImages for Emacs

AppImages for many versions of Emacs\*\*.

AppImages are built on GitHub Actions and distributed

I used https://github.com/probonopd/Emacs.AppImage as a starting point.

- 28 :: Usable. Next: fix pdmp, enable native compilation
- 27 :: Usable. Next: fix pdmp
- 26 :: Usable.
- 25 :: Usable. (xwidgets turned off)
- 24 ::
  : ./stdio.h:1030:1: error: ‘gets’ undeclared here (not in a function)
  : _GL_WARN_ON_USE (gets, "gets is a security hole - use fgets instead");
- 23.4 ::
  : /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread_nonshared.a(pthread_atfork.oS): In function `__pthread_atfork':
  : /build/glibc-CVJwZb/glibc-2.27/nptl/pthread_atfork.c:51: undefined reference to `__dso_handle'
  : /usr/bin/ld: temacs: hidden symbol `__dso_handle' isn't defined
- 23.2b ::
  : gcc-4.8: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-2.0/’
- 22 :: Make returns error; probably needs ancient Make
- 21 :: no support for x86-64

** Todos
- Emacs 27 pdmp isn't being loaded properly
- Enable native compilation for 28 (probably requires pdmp to work properly)
- Also build for other minor versions
- Enable xwidgets

  Needs [[https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev][libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev]]

- Emacs <= 23

  These need GCC 4.8, it seems.
