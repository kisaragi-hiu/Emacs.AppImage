* Patches

Extra patches would come here.

If we for some reason ever want/need to run Emacs undumped, we'll probably need the patch from [[https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/433][github:termux/termux-packages#433]].

This folder was previously created to host that patch, before [[https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/Emacs.AppImage/issues/2][#2]] was fixed.
